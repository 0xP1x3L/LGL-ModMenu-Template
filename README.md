Tutorial in video is quite old, but some ways still work.

About tutorial below, you can read how to inject mod in to apk file.

# How to inject mod menu in to Game APKs.

Decompile the game's APK file if you haven't done so already.

After you build your app by Android Studio, nevigate to lib app foulder.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO COPY FILE lib .so of app to lib game. 

Make sure you copy correct Architectures lib app to lib game.

## Step 1: Edit the game's AndroidManifest.xml file

Open the AndroidManifest.xml file of the game you want to inject the mod.

Add the following line inside the <manifest> tag if it does not exist:
```XML
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```
Add this line in bottom, you can follow video to know where to add.
```XML
<service android:name="com.android.support.Launcher" android:enabled="true" android:exported="false" android:stopWithTask="true"/>
```
You can find these line in your app ```AndroidManifest.xml``` file.

Note this <application> tag, if the decomplie fails due to full dex classes, need to create a new smali_classesX:
```XML
<application android:appCategory="game" android:appComponentFactory="androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory" android:hardwareAccelerated="true" android:icon="@mipmap/app_icon" android:isGame="true" android:label="@string/app_name" android:name="androidx.multidex.MultiDexApplication" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/tp_network_security_config" android:roundIcon="@mipmap/app_icon_round" android:supportsRtl="true" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen" android:usesCleartextTraffic="true">
```
Need to change to ```android:name="androidx.multidex.MultiDexApplication"``` and then create a folder named smali_classesX (where X is a zero in the existing folders)

## Step 2: Edit the smali file of the MainActivity in the game

Decompile the game's APK file if you haven't done so already.

Find the smali file corresponding to the game's MainActivity. 

Example:

GameDecompiledAPK/smali/com/some_path/some_path/MainActivity.smali.

Open the Main smali file with a text editor.

Search for the onCreate method. It should look like this:

```Smali
.method protected onCreate(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V

# [We need add code here]

return-void
.end method
```
Add the following line of code right after the invoke-super line in the onCreate method:

```Smali
invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/android/support/Main;->StartWithoutPermission(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```
Note this: If you have force closing game when open try to change the line of main smali
```Smali
invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/android/support/Main;->Start(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```

Step 3: Recompile and re-sign the game APK

Important Note:
Make sure you have backed up the original game APK file before making any changes.

Good luck with your mod injection!
